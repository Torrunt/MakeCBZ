## MakeCBZ

Easily make uncompressed .cbz files (comic book zip) to use with your favourite reader (eg: CDisplayEx).
Why uncompressed? So your reader can open them faster. There is no real reason to use actual compressed zips for cbz files, as they don't really reduce the size that much.

### Install
- Place MakeCBZ.exe in your Program Files or Utils Folder (wherever you put random programs/tools)
- Copy and paste a shortcut of it in your shell:sendto folder (simply type or paste shell:sendto into Windows Explorer)
- Rename it to "CBZ"

### Usage
[Right-click folder -> Send to -> CBZ] to create a new CBZ from the contents

[Right-click .cbz, .cbr, .zip or .rar -> Send to -> CBZ] to convert them to a (uncompressed) CBZ
##### Example
With a folder structure like below you can right-click -> CBZ the Volume 01 folder to create a file called "Title - Volume 01.cbz"
```
Title
- Volume 01
-- Chapter 01
--- 01.jpg
--- 02.jpg
--- ...
-- Chapter 02
--- ...
```
